        WEBSITE CONTENT DOCTRINE

This doctrine governs all written content across every website in the Iron Local portfolio.

It defines and enforces:
	•	Content structure
	•	Minimum word counts
	•	SEO requirements
	•	Conversion intent
	•	Legal positioning
	•	Tone and authority consistency

This doctrine is referenced before any content is written.
It is not optional.

⸻

CORE SEO & STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

(NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Page Word Counts
	•	Homepage: minimum 2,150 words
	•	Service Page: minimum 750 words
	•	Location Page: minimum 750 words

No exceptions.
No shortcuts.

⸻

KEYWORD PLACEMENT RULES
	•	Main keyword + location must appear in the H1
	•	On the homepage
	•	On all relevant money pages
	•	Keyword usage must:
	•	Flow naturally
	•	Never feel forced
	•	Never reduce readability for SEO tricks

SEO exists to support clarity — not replace it.

⸻

CONTENT POSITIONING & LANGUAGE RULES

How Services Are Described
Content must clearly explain:
	•	How the service works
	•	How the process is carried out correctly
	•	What makes the service reliable, effective, and professional

Avoid language that:
	•	Overuses “we” or “our”
	•	Claims “what we do differently”
	•	Suggests marketplace-style lead brokering
	•	Sounds like Checkatrade, Bark, or a directory

Preferred Framing
	•	“How concrete bases are properly installed”
	•	“What sets this service apart”
	•	“How this process is handled professionally”

The site must feel like:

A specialist service authority — not a middleman.

⸻

LEGAL SAFETY & FOOTER RULES

(MANDATORY)

Homepage + Services Pages Footer
Must include a subtle legal protection line, for example:

© 2025 Concrete Shed Base Watford — Managed installation service.
Our partners are accredited and insured via our vetted network.
Not an employment provider.

This protects:
	•	Lead-generation positioning
	•	Liability exposure
	•	Partner relationship clarity

All Other Pages Footer
Use only a simple copyright line, for example:

© 2025 Concrete Shed Base Enfield.

No extra disclaimers.
No legal padding.

⸻

SCHEMA & TECHNICAL SEO REQUIREMENTS
	•	Schema markup is required on all money pages
	•	Schema must:
	•	Be consistent across pages
	•	Match page intent
	•	Be optimised for Google understanding
	•	Avoid overengineering

Schema must never conflict between pages.

⸻

CONVERSION & TRUST OBJECTIVES

(EVERY PAGE)

Every page must be engineered to:
	•	Convert organic SEO traffic
	•	Convert Google Ads traffic
	•	Build strong trust and authority
	•	Maintain legal safety for a lead-generation model
	•	Match the exact tone, positioning, and credibility of the homepage

No page is allowed to feel different from the homepage.

Consistency is authority.

⸻

TONE & UX PRINCIPLES

All content must remain:
	•	Calm
	•	Confident
	•	Professional
	•	Service-focused
	•	Non-hype
	•	Clear and instructional without being patronising

The site should feel like:

A specialist operator explaining a proven process.

⸻

ENFORCEMENT RULE

This doctrine overrides:
	•	Individual writer preferences
	•	Ad-hoc SEO tactics
	•	Short-term optimisation urges

If content conflicts with this doctrine,
the content is wrong — not the doctrine.

      <div class="vault-subsection">
        <h4>Concrete Bases</h4>
        <textarea class="vault-textarea" readonly>

You are writing content for a local concrete shed base service page or blog.

The service is concrete shed base installation for residential properties.

The audience is homeowners who want a durable, level base for sheds, garden buildings, or small structures. They care about longevity, drainage, and not having to redo the job.

The tone must be calm, competent, and factual — not salesy.

Do NOT use phrases like “our team,” “we’re the best,” or exaggerated claims.

Describe the service itself, how the process works, what problems poor bases cause, and what a correct installation looks like.

Emphasise practicality, ground preparation, longevity, and suitability for UK gardens.

Assume work is carried out by vetted local partners.

Structure content with clear H2s, short paragraphs, and bullet points where helpful.

Use the exact service + location naturally in headings.

Write for humans first, SEO second.

That’s it.
That one prompt governs everything concrete-base related.
